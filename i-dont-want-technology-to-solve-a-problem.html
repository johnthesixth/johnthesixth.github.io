    <p>Recently I bought an iPhone 6 Plus. I love everything about it, including the ridiculous size. I suppose I didn’t need to spend so much money on it; I could have bought an Android, but I’ve always had an aversion to that platform for one very specific reason:</p>

<p>It was built as an alternative to the iPhone.</p>

<p>Yes, I’m aware that that’s precisely why most people like it. They also like it because it’s cheaper and it’s on every mobile carrier. Android phones were also the first to offer larger sizes that Apple didn’t adopt until the iPhone 6. In many cases it even has more memory (although it’s not as good as iOS in using that memory).</p>

<p>But here is what I find striking about Android: I’ve never met a die-hard Android fan. I’ve never met anyone whose fervor for Android reminds you of the Apple fanboys and fangirls who line up in front of an Apple store weeks ahead of a product release. I’ve never met a single individual who truly, honestly, certainly, unwaveringly believes that the Android platform is the best and only solution for how mobile devices should be.</p>

<p>I do, however, know plenty of Android fans who dislike Apple. And that’s the perfect symptom of the problem plaguing Android.</p>

<p>When Apple released the Macintosh in 1984, it was the realization of a vision: technology should not only be accessible for the masses, but it should be a work of art in itself. Steve Jobs was even concerned about the interior of the computer because he knew what was in there, and he couldn’t tolerate good design outside with poor design inside. Years later, the iPod continued this vision: it took advances in audio compression technology and coupled those with unique design to give everybody 1000 songs in your pocket. The iPhone did it again: it took the best that cellular and wireless networking technology had to offer, united it with the iPod, and what resulted was a unique, innovative piece of technology that has influenced hardware, software, and the web ever since.</p>

<p>I’ve always understood Apple’s approach to be philosophical at its core. The way Apple creates technology is with a commitment to the premise that a specific category of things - computers and personal electronics - are the very best they can be only when the aesthetics, hardware and software are built in unison with one another. It’s a vision that few have attempted to duplicate and even fewer have succeeded at, because it’s a vision that requires a clear, concentrated focus. It requires a focus on what the best computer or device of a certain type should be, it requires a very specific vision of what that computer or device should do, and together those inform the vision of how that computer or device should be made.</p>

<p>In other words, the technology that is created originates with a vision of the right way this technology should be.
Naturally, the extension of this is that every part of the device is built with focused intentionality: if a battery can only be a certain size in the device, then the OS can only run so many background processes at once, or else the battery will lose charge at a rate that makes it highly inefficient for the user. Or if, as mentioned above, the iPhone has half the RAM of an Android phone, it can still be twice as efficient because the OS was built around it, tailored specifically to using that much RAM, which has only a specific amount of power draw, again influencing battery charge. Every part of the device is built with the motivation that any other way is inferior, and that any other way of building it does not reflect the nature of the device itself. Any other way is not the way this thing should be.</p>

<p>Android did not exist until someone asked, “Is there anyone who makes an iPhone, but cheaper?” When contrasted with Apple’s vision of how technology should be, this question sounds crass and grating. It sounds like the focus is not on presenting an alternative vision of the way technology should be, but rather on creating something that is made for no other reason than to be sold in a niche to generate cash.</p>

<p>The problem I see plaguing Android is that it is an opportunistic reaction to a focused vision for how the world should be. And regardless of how well-made something might be, or how good something is at solving a problem, it seems to me that nothing can be truly exceptional if its conception is reactionary. The things we make, and the technology we create, can never be a proper reflection of our belief in the way the world should be if the only reason we make it is because we see an opportunity to sell something that is <em>not</em> thing <em>x</em>.</p>

<p>When the iPhone was released, there was a problem: people wanted the function of the iPhone, but they did not want to pay more money for the iPhone. So, Google saw the opportunity to launch an alternative, and to pursue a model proven to keep cost down: license the technology to manufacturers who already had supply chains in place, and let them dictate its implementation. The resulting products were certainly cheaper, and more well-suited to a consumer who had the problem of not wanting to spend the money required to buy an iPhone. Android solved their problem. But that’s all it did. That’s why I’ve never met an Android user who was sold on the platform, head over heels. That’s why I’ve met a lot of Android users who dislike Apple, but none who believe that Android is a proper reflection of the way that mobile technology should be.</p>

<p>I should make it clear that I don’t think there is a problem with someone owning an Android device. There are lots of very good, practical, long-term reasons to own an Android. The one that strikes closest to my own heart would be the example of the individual who is on a strict budget because she’s paying off debt and getting herself out of a hole of her own making. If that’s her focus - and living without debt <em>is</em> the way that the world should be - then she can’t afford to spend top dollar when cheaper alternatives are available. To this extent, owning an Android device might actually help her achieve her vision of how her life should be.</p>

<p>Even so, in my own experience I’ve never been able to justify to myself spending the money on a device I’m dispassionate about. I want my technology to be representative and reflective of the way I choose to live my life and do my work: it needs to start with a vision grounded in a clear philosophy. The philosophy needs to define some way the world should be, and the vision needs to offer a blueprint for how that philosophy is implemented.</p>

<p>Alternative choices in products or services that are made as cheaper versions of some technology or other will always have a place in the market. Implementing a vision grounded in clear philosophy does not come cheap, and there will always be people who place higher value on the amount of money left in their wallet after the transaction than on the implementation of the vision for that technology. There’s nothing wrong with this.</p>

<p>However, I simply don’t think that’s the way the world should be.</p>
