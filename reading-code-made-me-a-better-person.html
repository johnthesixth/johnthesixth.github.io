  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve known a handful of people in my life who aren’t very good readers. They stumbled through words, and seemed to need more than a second’s pause between each one (which is very long when someone is reading out loud). Listening to them read was a torturous experience for me, and I’m sure it was even worse for them. The really bad part of it was that there was always some part of me that was happy I wasn’t like that. I’ve always been a strong reader, able to go at any speed I need to. When I read out loud, I have an intuitive sense of where to place the proper emphasis and flourish. It’s rare for me to have the need to read a line twice. I know that there are a lot of people who can’t read as well as I do, and who don’t enjoy it as much as I do.</p>

<p>This was an ability I’d come to take for granted. And while my immature self would never admit it (and my more mature self still has a hard time admitting it), I’m certain that there were times I questioned people’s intelligence who didn’t have my ability to read. I dared to presume that I knew what a person could be and do simply because they did not have this one specific, local ability that I have; an ability that, while better than average, is so far from exceptional that it will never be recognized in any record books.</p>

<p>Thankfully, refreshingly, code unseated me from this grand high horse I’d come to assume was mine by right.</p>

<p>Learning to read code knocked me down, planted me on my back with my feet in the air, and put me squarely in the seat of those readers who stumble through each word, frustrated with themselves, who feel that overwhelming sense of “I’ll never get this.”</p>

<p>Learning to read code did this to me because there is only one way to read code:</p>

<p>Slowly.</p>

<p>I <em>hate</em> reading slowly.</p>

<p>Reading slowly takes time.</p>

<p>With all the years I’ve had to get better at reading print and prose, I’ve become quite good at reading. This has made it easy for me to fly my eyes over a paragraph and easily get the gist of it. It’s also made me more impatient, a character flaw with which the amount of content we’re thrown every day has not helped. For most content, especially content on the web, I skim. Like everyone else with a computer and Internet connection, I’m inundated with so much content on a multiplicity of feeds that I simply don’t read everything. I judge articles by their titles, and from that determine whether I’m going to give the article the dignity of a gloss-over.</p>

<p>Usually this goes one of two ways. The first is that I start “reading” (skimming) the article, then get bored by the end of the second paragraph. I move on to the next thing. The second is that I actually manage to skim to the end of the article, think to myself, “That was pretty good,” and then move on to the next anyway.</p>

<p>This is lazy. It’s downright arrogant. It’s an abuse of a gift.</p>

<p>Code stubbornly refuses to accept my laziness. It makes me work hard.</p>

<p>Code is thorough. It is precise. It is unforgiving. If I read “wsetren” when someone actually meant “western,” I don’t miss what they meant. I subconsciously rearrange the word into the proper order.</p>

<p>Code does not give half a flying unicorn’s rainbow fart about my ability to infer.</p>

<p>Code is selfish, self-absorbed, and egotistical.</p>

<p>Code demands my undivided attention, and has not reserved forgiveness for that time I read “O” as “zero.”</p>

<p>Code has demanded that I pay careful attention to what I’m reading, and punishes me for making a mistake in the code that I’m writing.</p>

<p>Code is a fascinating teacher.</p>

<p>The real reason I want to read code quickly is because I’m looking for a quick fix. I want to understand how a great app or website is written, right now, and I want to implement my own version — right now. But anything worth doing well takes time.</p>

<p>Creation is one of the things most worth doing.</p>

<p>Creation of art, creation of story, creation of of an application — all of it is worth it in the end, but only for the people who have the patience to accept that the finished creation is worth more than the time it took to make it. It’s worth it only if you are willing to let code teach you with all of its selfishness and brutality and utter lack of forgiveness.</p>

<p>Code put me in my place. It made me remember that I am a student and that I cannot bring this skill I’ve come to take for granted with me, expecting it to serve me as well for code as it has for prose. Code slaps it out of my hand, punches me in the face, knocks me on my back, and makes me get up and take one step. And then another. And only one at a time.</p>

<p>Code made me a better person because it reminded me that I’m at a starting point.</p>
